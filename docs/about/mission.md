# Mission & Vision

## Our Mission

**To revolutionize the understanding and analysis of women's professional soccer by creating the most sophisticated analytics platform in the sport.**

The National Women's Soccer League represents the pinnacle of women's professional soccer in North America. Yet despite the incredible talent, tactical complexity, and competitive drama that defines the NWSL, the league has lacked the analytical depth that has transformed other major sports.

We're changing that.

## Why the NWSL Needs Advanced Analytics

### The Current State
Most soccer analysis relies on basic counting statistics:
- Goals and assists
- Shots and saves  
- Simple possession percentages
- Win-loss records

While these metrics provide a starting point, they miss the deeper story of what actually drives success in professional soccer.

### The Transformation We're Building

Just as sabermetrics revolutionized baseball by moving beyond batting average to more meaningful metrics like OPS (On-base Plus Slugging), we're bringing that same analytical rigor to women's soccer.

!!! example "The Baseball Parallel"
    In baseball, analysts discovered that batting average explained only 46% of the variation in team run production, while OPS explained 89%. This revelation transformed how teams evaluate players and make strategic decisions.
    
    We're applying the same methodology to soccer, identifying which metrics actually correlate with team success versus those that just sound impressive.

## Our Vision

### A World Where...

- **Coaches** make tactical decisions backed by data-driven insights about player roles, matchup advantages, and strategic optimization
- **Players** understand their true impact beyond the scoresheet, with personalized development recommendations based on comprehensive performance analysis
- **Fans** engage with the sport at a deeper level, appreciating the tactical nuances and individual contributions that traditional statistics miss
- **Media** tells richer stories about the game, supported by meaningful analytics that reveal the "why" behind results
- **Front Offices** build rosters strategically, identifying undervalued talent and optimizing team chemistry through advanced metrics

### The Platform We're Building

Our vision extends beyond just providing statistics. We're creating:

1. **Educational Foundation**: Helping people understand not just what the numbers say, but why they matter
2. **Transparent Methodology**: Complete openness about our analytical approaches, limitations, and assumptions
3. **Accessible Intelligence**: Complex analysis presented in ways that serve both casual fans and professional analysts
4. **Community Resource**: A platform that elevates discussion and understanding across the entire NWSL ecosystem

## What Drives Us

### Respect for the Game
The NWSL features world-class athletes competing at the highest level. The analysis should match that quality.

### Commitment to Truth
We'd rather admit what we don't know than oversell what we do. Our analysis acknowledges uncertainty and clearly communicates confidence levels.

### Passion for Progress  
Every insight we generate should serve the broader goal of helping the league, teams, and players improve.

### Belief in Transparency
Advanced analytics can seem like a "black box." We believe in showing our work and explaining our reasoning.

## Success Metrics

We'll know we're succeeding when:

- **NWSL discussions** become more sophisticated, moving beyond surface-level analysis
- **Player development** benefits from data-driven insights about role optimization
- **Tactical innovation** accelerates as coaches gain better tools for analysis
- **Fan engagement** deepens through richer understanding of the game
- **Academic research** builds upon our open methodologies to push the field forward

## Long-Term Impact

Our ultimate goal isn't just to create better soccer statistics. It's to contribute to the growth and sophistication of women's professional soccer as a whole.

By providing the analytical foundation that other major sports take for granted, we're helping the NWSL reach its full potential as a league that showcases the world's best players competing at the highest tactical and strategic level.

*The mission is ambitious, but the NWSL deserves nothing less than the most sophisticated analytical approach we can build.*
