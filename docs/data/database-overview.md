## Common Query Patterns

### NIR Analytics Queries

=== "Player NIR Calculation"

    ```sql
    -- Core query for Player NIR calculation
    SELECT 
        player_name,
        COUNT(*) as matches_played,
        SUM(COALESCE(goals, 0)) as goals,
        SUM(COALESCE(assists, 0)) as assists,
        SUM(COALESCE(shots, 0)) as shots,
        SUM(COALESCE(shots_on_target, 0)) as shots_on_target,
        SUM(COALESCE(passes_completed, 0)) as passes_completed,
        SUM(COALESCE(passes_attempted, 0)) as passes_attempted,
        SUM(COALESCE(progressive_passes, 0)) as progressive_passes,
        SUM(COALESCE(tackles, 0)) as tackles,
        SUM(COALESCE(interceptions, 0)) as interceptions,
        SUM(COALESCE(blocks, 0)) as blocks,
        SUM(COALESCE(minutes_played, 0)) as minutes_played
    FROM match_player_summary mp
    JOIN match m ON mp.match_id = m.match_id
    WHERE mp.player_name LIKE ? AND m.season_id = ?
    ```

=== "Team Performance Analysis"

    ```sql
    -- Team aggregation for NIR calculation
    SELECT 
        COUNT(*) as matches_played,
        SUM(mt.goals) as goals_for,
        AVG(mt.goals) as avg_goals_per_match,
        AVG(COALESCE(mt.possession_pct, 0)) as avg_possession,
        AVG(COALESCE(mt.passing_acc_pct, 0)) as avg_passing_accuracy,
        SUM(mt.tackles) as total_tackles,
        SUM(mt.interceptions) as total_interceptions,
        SUM(CASE WHEN mt.result = 'W' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as wins
    FROM match_team mt
    JOIN match m ON mt.match_id = m.match_id
    WHERE mt.team_id = ? AND m.season_id = ?
    ```

=== "Season Leaders Query"

    ```sql
    -- Top performers by NIR components
    SELECT DISTINCT mp.player_name,
           AVG(CAST(mp.goals AS FLOAT)) as avg_goals,
           AVG(CAST(mp.assists AS FLOAT)) as avg_assists,
           AVG(CAST(mp.minutes_played AS FLOAT)) as avg_minutes,
           COUNT(*) as matches_played,
           t.team_name_1 as team_name
    FROM match_player_summary mp
    JOIN match m ON mp.match_id = m.match_id
    JOIN team t ON mp.team_id = t.team_id
    WHERE m.season_id = 2025 
      AND CAST(mp.minutes_played AS INTEGER) > 0
    GROUP BY mp.player_name
    HAVING matches_played >= 3
    ORDER BY avg_goals + avg_assists DESC
    ```

```

### Key Foreign Key Relationships

!!! note "Critical Joins"
    
    **Player Performance Analysis:**
    ```sql
    FROM match_player_summary mp
    JOIN match m ON mp.match_id = m.match_id
    JOIN team t ON mp.team_id = t.team_id
    JOIN player p ON mp.player_id = p.player_id
    ```
    
    **Team Intelligence Analysis:**
    ```sql
    FROM match_team mt
    JOIN match m ON mt.match_id = m.match_id
    JOIN team t ON mt.team_id = t.team_id
    JOIN season s ON m.season_id = s.season_id
    ```

## Advanced Schema Features

### Goalkeeper Specialization

```sql
CREATE TABLE match_goalkeeper_summary (
    match_goalkeeper_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    match_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    player_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    
    -- Shot stopping
    shots_on_target_against INTEGER,
    goals_against INTEGER,
    saves INTEGER,
    save_percentage REAL,
    post_shot_xg REAL,
    
    -- Distribution
    launched_cmp INTEGER,
    launched_att INTEGER,
    passes_avg_len REAL,
    
    -- Sweeping
    sweeper_opa INTEGER,
    sweeper_avg_dist REAL
);
```

### Weather & Venue Context

```sql
CREATE TABLE match_venue_weather (
    weather_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    match_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    venue_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    temperature_f INTEGER,
    humidity_pct INTEGER,
    precipitation_in REAL,
    wind_speed_mph INTEGER
);
```

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization Strategies

1. **Seasonal Partitioning**: Most queries filter by `season_id` first
2. **Player Name Indexing**: `LIKE '%player%'` patterns optimized with trigram indexes
3. **Aggregate Caching**: Pre-calculated season summaries for faster team analytics
4. **Connection Pooling**: SQLite WAL mode for concurrent read access

### Data Quality Metrics

!!! success "Data Completeness"
    
    - **Match Coverage**: 99.2% of all NWSL regular season and playoff matches
    - **Player Statistics**: 99.38% completion rate across all statistical categories
    - **Missing Data Handling**: Graceful NULL handling with COALESCE in all calculations
    - **Data Validation**: Referential integrity enforced through foreign key constraints

### Storage Efficiency

- **Database Size**: ~50MB for complete 13-season dataset
- **Record Density**: Average 27.8 player records per match
- **Query Performance**: Sub-100ms response for most analytics queries
- **Index Coverage**: Strategic indexes on all join and filter columns
