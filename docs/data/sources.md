# Data Sources & Collection

## Primary Data Sources

Our comprehensive NWSL database is built from multiple authoritative sources, each validated and cross-referenced to ensure accuracy and completeness.

### **FBRef (Sports Reference)**

**Primary statistical source** for detailed player and team performance data.

#### **What We Collect**
- Individual player statistics for every match
- Team-level performance metrics
- Advanced statistics (xG, xA, progressive actions)
- Detailed passing, shooting, and defensive data

#### **Why FBRef**
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Most complete statistical tracking available
- **Consistent methodology**: Standardized data collection across seasons
- **Advanced metrics**: Beyond basic statistics to tactical intelligence
- **Historical depth**: Complete coverage back to 2013

#### **Data Processing**
```
FBRef Match Pages → HTML Parsing → Statistical Extraction → Database Integration
```

- Custom extraction engines handle format evolution
- Validation against multiple data points per match
- Automated consistency checking across seasons

### **Official NWSL Records**

**Secondary validation source** for match results and context.

#### **What We Use**
- Final scores and match results
- Team roster information
- Season structure and playoff formats
- Official player names and positions

#### **Purpose**
- **Result verification**: Ensure statistical accuracy
- **Context validation**: Confirm match circumstances
- **Player identification**: Standardize names across seasons
- **Timeline verification**: Accurate date and season assignment

### **Historical Archives**

**Supplementary sources** for comprehensive coverage.

#### **Coverage Includes**
- Early season statistics (2013-2015)
- Missing match data recovery
- Player career tracking across teams
- League structure evolution documentation

## Data Collection Process

### **Automated Extraction Pipeline**

#### **Stage 1: Source Identification**
```python
# Match Discovery Process
1. Identify all NWSL matches for target season
2. Generate FBRef URLs for statistical pages
3. Validate URL accessibility and data availability
4. Queue matches for processing
```

#### **Stage 2: Statistical Extraction**
```python  
# Core Processing Engine
1. Parse HTML match pages using specialized extractors
2. Extract player-level statistics (35+ fields per player)
3. Extract team-level aggregated data
4. Handle format variations across seasons
```

#### **Stage 3: Data Validation**
```python
# Quality Assurance Pipeline  
1. Cross-reference extracted data with known results
2. Identify statistical outliers for manual review
3. Validate player name consistency
4. Check for missing or corrupted data
```

#### **Stage 4: Database Integration**
```python
# Storage and Normalization
1. Normalize player and team identities
2. Store in relational database structure
3. Generate completion reports
4. Update aggregated statistics 
```

### **Processing Performance**

Our collection system achieves:

- **Processing speed**: ~35 records per second average
- **Match success rate**: 100% for seasons with available HTML files
- **Error rate**: <0.1% requiring manual correction
- **Update frequency**: New data integrated within 24-48 hours

## Data Format Handling

### **Evolution Across Seasons**

The NWSL's statistical tracking has evolved significantly, requiring sophisticated format handling:

#### **2013-2018: Legacy Format**
```
Statistical Fields: 24 per player per match
Format Characteristics:
- Basic performance metrics (goals, assists, shots)
- Age format: "YY-DDD" (year-day of year)  
- Limited passing and defensive statistics
- Manual extraction and validation required
```

#### **2019-2025: Modern Format** 
```
Statistical Fields: 37+ per player per match
Enhanced Data:
- Expected Goals (xG) and Expected Assists (xA)
- Progressive passes and carries
- Shot creation and goal creation actions
- Detailed defensive actions and positioning
```

### **Format Compatibility Engine**

Our system automatically detects and processes both formats:

```python
def determine_format(match_data):
    """Automatically detect statistical format"""
    if 'xg' in available_fields:
        return ModernFormatProcessor()
    else:
        return LegacyFormatProcessor()
```

Benefits:
- **Seamless processing** across all 13 seasons
- **Consistent output** despite input format variations
- **Historical accuracy** maintained across format transitions
- **Future compatibility** for ongoing format evolution

## Quality Control Measures

### **Automated Validation**

#### **Statistical Consistency Checks**
- Goals + assists ≤ total shot creation actions
- Minutes played ≤ 90 (plus stoppage time allowance)
- Team totals match individual player sums
- Pass completion rates within realistic ranges

#### **Cross-Match Validation**
- Player appears for only one team per match
- Season totals aggregate correctly from individual matches
- Historical player tracking maintains identity consistency

#### **Temporal Validation**
- Match dates align with official season calendars
- Player ages progress logically across seasons
- Team participation consistent with league membership

### **Manual Review Process**

#### **Statistical Outlier Investigation**
When automated checks identify anomalies:
1. **Source verification**: Return to original data source
2. **Context analysis**: Consider match circumstances  
3. **Historical comparison**: Compare to player's typical performance
4. **Manual correction**: Update database if error confirmed

#### **Edge Case Handling**
- **Player name variations**: Standardize across seasons
- **Position changes**: Track tactical role evolution
- **Team transfers**: Maintain accurate player-team associations
- **Statistical anomalies**: Verify extraordinary performances

### **Data Integrity Monitoring**

#### **Continuous Monitoring**
- **Weekly reports**: Completion rates and quality metrics
- **Anomaly detection**: Automated flagging of unusual patterns
- **Source monitoring**: Track changes in data availability
- **Performance tracking**: Processing speed and error rates

#### **Historical Validation**
- **Seasonal audits**: Complete review of each season's data
- **Cross-reference checking**: Validate against multiple sources
- **Longitudinal analysis**: Identify trends and inconsistencies
- **Community feedback**: Incorporate corrections from users

## Data Collection Challenges

### **Source Reliability Issues**

#### **Website Structure Changes**
- FBRef occasionally modifies page layouts
- Requires extraction engine updates
- Implemented robust parsing with multiple fallback methods

#### **Data Availability Gaps**
- Some early season matches lack detailed statistics
- Weather and venue data inconsistently available
- Goalkeeper statistics limited in certain seasons

### **Format Evolution Complexity**

#### **Statistical Definition Changes**
- Certain metrics redefined across seasons
- Requires careful historical interpretation
- Clear documentation of definitional changes

#### **League Structure Evolution**
- Playoff format changes affect seasonal statistics
- Team expansion impacts competitive balance
- COVID-19 season required special handling

### **Scale and Performance Considerations**

#### **Processing Volume**
- 42,572+ individual player records
- 1,563 matches across 13 seasons
- Multiple statistical fields per record

#### **Storage and Access**
- Efficient database design for fast queries
- Indexed for common analytical operations
- Optimized for both historical analysis and real-time updates

## Future Enhancements

### **Planned Improvements**

#### **Data Source Expansion**
- Integration of additional statistical providers
- Enhanced venue and weather data collection  
- Player biographical and career information

#### **Real-Time Processing**
- Live match statistics integration
- Faster processing pipeline for current season
- Automated anomaly detection and correction

#### **Enhanced Validation**
- Machine learning-based outlier detection
- Automated cross-source verification
- Predictive data quality assessment
