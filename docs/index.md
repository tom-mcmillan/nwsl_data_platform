## What We're Building

The National Women's Soccer League deserves the same analytical sophistication that transformed baseball, basketball, and men's soccer. We're building the most comprehensive NWSL analytics platform ever created, moving far beyond basic statistics to provide meaningful insights that matter.

### Our Mission

**To revolutionize the understanding and analysis of women's professional soccer by creating the most sophisticated analytics platform in the sport.**

The National Women's Soccer League represents the pinnacle of women's professional soccer in North America. Yet despite the incredible talent, tactical complexity, and competitive drama that defines the NWSL, the league has lacked the analytical depth that has transformed other major sports.

We're changing that.

### Why This Matters

Traditional soccer statistics tell an incomplete story. Goals and assists are important, but they miss the nuanced contributions that truly impact team success. Our platform introduces:

- **Composite Performance Metrics**: Like baseball's move from batting average to OPS, we combine multiple performance dimensions
- **Context-Adjusted Analysis**: Understanding performance relative to opposition strength and game situations  
- **Predictive Indicators**: Metrics that actually correlate with future success
- **Tactical Intelligence**: Automated identification of playing styles and tactical patterns

!!! example "The Baseball Parallel"
    In baseball, analysts discovered that batting average explained only 46% of the variation in team run production, while OPS explained 89%. This revelation transformed how teams evaluate players and make strategic decisions.
    
    We're applying the same methodology to soccer, identifying which metrics actually correlate with team success versus those that just sound impressive.

## What Makes Us Different

### Sabermetrics for Soccer

We've adapted proven statistical methodologies from baseball's analytical revolution:

=== "Traditional Approach"
    - Goals scored
    - Assists made
    - Basic counting stats
    - Surface-level analysis

=== "Our Advanced Approach"
    - **NWSL Impact Rating (NIR)**: Composite metric combining attacking, defensive, and progression impacts
    - **Context Adjustments**: Performance weighted by opposition quality and game state
    - **Predictive Indicators**: Metrics tested for year-over-year correlation stability
    - **Tactical Profiling**: Automated playing style identification

### Unmatched Data Foundation

Our analysis is built on the most comprehensive NWSL database ever assembled:

| Metric | Coverage |
|--------|----------|
| **Seasons Covered** | 13 complete seasons (2013-2025) |
| **Data Completeness** | 99.38% across all records |
| **Player Records** | 42,572 individual match performances |
| **Matches Analyzed** | 1,563 with detailed statistics |
| **Statistical Dimensions** | 35+ metrics per player per match |

The database represents over **99.38% data completion** across 13 consecutive seasons, making it the most comprehensive NWSL statistical resource ever created.

#### Data Sources & Collection

## NWSL Impact Rating (NIR)

Our flagship metric combines multiple performance dimensions into a single, meaningful measure of player contribution.

### Methodology

The NIR system addresses fundamental limitations in traditional soccer statistics:

**Traditional Problem**: Goals and assists capture only the final touch of scoring plays
**NIR Solution**: Comprehensive evaluation of attacking, defensive, and progressive contributions

### Components

1. **Attacking Impact**
   - Goal creation efficiency
   - Shot generation quality
   - Final third involvement

2. **Defensive Impact**
   - Possession disruption
   - Defensive actions per opportunity
   - Territorial control contribution

3. **Progression Impact**
   - Ball advancement effectiveness
   - Transition contribution
   - Build-up play involvement

### Context Adjustments

NIR ratings are adjusted for:
- Opposition strength
- Game situation (score, time)
- Player position and role
- Team tactical system
