# MCP Server

## Model Context Protocol Integration

The NWSL Advanced Analytics Intelligence platform leverages OpenAI's Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide sophisticated sports analytics capabilities through a remote HTTP server architecture.

### What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol is OpenAI's standardized approach for AI systems to access external tools and data sources. Our implementation provides:

- **Remote HTTP Access**: Cloud-deployed server accessible from any MCP-compatible client
- **Intelligent Tools**: 15+ sophisticated analytics tools covering the complete NWSL analysis workflow
- **Production Ready**: Enterprise-grade deployment with monitoring and error handling

### Key Capabilities

=== "Advanced Analytics"
    
    - **NWSL Impact Rating (NIR)**: Proprietary composite metrics beyond traditional statistics
    - **Team Intelligence**: Tactical profiling and performance prediction
    - **Player Analysis**: Multi-dimensional performance evaluation
    - **Historical Context**: Season-by-season trend analysis

=== "AI Visualization"
    
    - **Context-Aware Charts**: Intelligent chart type selection based on conversation context
    - **Interactive Plotly Graphics**: Professional data visualizations
    - **Graceful Degradation**: Multiple fallback systems for reliability
    - **Real-time Generation**: Dynamic chart creation from live queries

=== "Production Deployment"
    
    - **Google Cloud Run**: Scalable serverless deployment
    - **FastMCP Framework**: High-performance HTTP streaming
    - **Comprehensive Logging**: Production monitoring and error tracking
    - **Database Integration**: Optimized SQLite connection management

### Getting Started

Our MCP server is accessible via HTTP at the production endpoint. The server follows OpenAI's MCP best practices for:

- High-level tool design that groups related functionality
- Context-aware processing that understands conversation history
- Robust error handling with graceful degradation
- Professional JSON responses with structured data
