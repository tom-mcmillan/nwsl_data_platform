## Why This Approach Works

Traditional soccer statistics tell an incomplete story. Goals and assists are important, but they miss the nuanced contributions that truly impact team success. Our platform introduces:

- **Composite Performance Metrics** - Like baseball's move from batting average to OPS, we combine multiple performance dimensions
- **Context-Adjusted Analysis** - Understanding performance relative to opposition strength and game situations  
- **Predictive Indicators** - Metrics that actually correlate with future success
- **Tactical Intelligence** - Automated identification of playing styles and tactical patterns

This is sabermetrics for soccer, bringing the analytical revolution that transformed baseball to women's professional soccer.
